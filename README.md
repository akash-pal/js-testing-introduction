## Unit Tests, Integration Tests & End-to-End Tests

Unit tests that test one isolated unit/ piece of code (e.g. a function)
Integration tests which test the combination of features (e.g. a function calling another function)
End-to-End (e2e) or UI tests which test a full interaction path in your app (e.g. the signup process)
